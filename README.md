# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to use machine learning and neural networks to determine if applicants will be successful or not when applying for alphabet soup. 

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?  
The variables that were targets in the model were application type and whether or not it was accepted.   
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?  
Classification type 
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?  
EIN and NAME  

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model. 
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? 
I selected 3 layers for the neural network.  
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?  
I was able to achieve the target model performance.  
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?  
Running the machine learning model multiple times and making adjustments to the preprocessing of the data. 


## Summary
The overall results of the Machine Learning model showed that the success of an application can be predicted using the neural network model, but not with perfect accuracy. There must be other factors to consider that impacted the accuracy of the model.
